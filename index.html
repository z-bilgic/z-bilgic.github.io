                        Hi there. I am a sophomore at <a href="https://www.eths.k12.il.us/" target="_blank">Evanston
                            Township Highschool</a>. I was born in Maryland. I moved to Evanston when I was two years old. Growing up in Evanston I was able to connect with
                            the community in many ways. I often volunteered at Evanston Public Library, and helped out at K-8 chess tournaments held at Evanston schools. I love
                            being able to be apart of my community, whether it be volunteering or participating in community activities with friends and family. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I love sketching and drawing, and am trying to teach myself how to draw digitally. I also have a couple short animations that I worked on.
                         I included a sample of my drawings at my <a href=art.html> art page</a>. In 2022, I won an 
                         <a href="https://www.district65.net/services/sustainability/d65-and-city-of-evanston-recycling-art-design-competition" target ="_blank">art contest in 
                        Evanston </a> to spread awareness about the importance of recycling. Recently, however, generative AI is becoming used more and more frequently, 
                        especially to replace time-consuming and occasionally expensive human art.</p>

                    <p>The more I learned about the negative impacts artificial intelligence could have the more I wanted to learn about the positive effects it could have. 
                        I completed an <a href="https://www.oakton.edu/about/news/2023/12/new-oakton-college-ai-certificate-will-prepare-students-for-cutting-edge-jobs.php" target="_blank">
                        AI certificate at Oakton Community College</a> and now know more about machine learning and applications of AI that are less popular commercially. 
                        On top of AI, I am also interested in science, technology, math, and chess. 
                        I included more information about my education and training in my <a href="cv.html">CV</a> page. </p>

                    <p> I wrote this page in HTML and CSS using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VS Code</a>. I got help from a W3
                        Schools <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap5/index.php" target="_blank"> tutorial</a> on bootstrap, and spent many hours researching and implementing it into 
                        this webpage.
